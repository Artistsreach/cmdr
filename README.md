# BrowserGPT

BrowserGPT is a chatbot that allows you to search the web and get answers to your questions. It is built with [Vercel AI SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ai) and [Browserbase](https://www.browserbase.com/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
